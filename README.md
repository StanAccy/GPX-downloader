# GPX-downloader
This chrome extension adds a GPX download button for the connect.garmin.com courses.

If you want to download courses you created on connect.garmin.com, this is the right extension for you. After installing it, you will notice a small button in the toolbar of your created route which allows you to download the route in the GPX format.

You may want to use this extension with your eTrex device which is not natively supported by Garmin Connect.
